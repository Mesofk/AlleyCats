AlleyCats - A most excellent game.

You seem to be reading the readme. The way that statement is false at the time of writing, but becomes true upon being read is pretty cool.

This game is about cats because people love cats. 
You are a cat. Your opponent is a cat. You each have six kittens and you want to get your kittens home.
But home is a long way away. You will have to venture though the back alleys to get there.

On your turn:
* Roll the dice
* Select a kitten to move
  - You can only move one kitten per turn
  - You can move the kitten the number of spaces you roll on the dice
  - If there is an opponents kitten in a space, you can try to chase it off. Tt will go back to the start unless it is in a safe space.
  - Likewise, the opponent can scare your kittens back to your start unless they are safe.
* Move the kitten
That's the end of your turn. Now your opponent has a go. Yay - sharing!

The first person to get all their kittens home wins.
